Tswalano is an app which will demonstrate some of my work I do in a production site for everyone to see. Goal is to create an online presence to show the skills i have and what I can build. Ideally the apps that will be deployed will be built in React, JavaScript, MySQL, Java and PHP (minor).

Goal is to create systems that can be used as a plug-and-play such as online payments, mobile apps, sending customized emails and so on. I am open for collaborations if you have ideas on what to build contact me. details on my profile.
